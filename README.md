*Short description of your project, in one or two sentences.* 

Compose a “readme” document in Markdown to serve as the front page for your personal repository, where you will submit your individual assignments. At a minimum, this document must include:

License information for the repository (the choice of license is up to you), which means the specific license type must be stated on the Readme page. You can link to the full text of the license (either in the repository or on another website) or include it on the Readme. If you choose a license that requires stating the copyright year and copyright holder, these blanks must be filled in or the license does not apply.

Placeholder text for linking the other two individual assignments (Data Entry Analysis and Data Exploration). Literally, the names of the assignments that you can later turn into hyperlinks when you submit these assignments.
An image of your choosing; make sure it’s safe for work.
Make sure the page is well formatted for easy reading: take advantage of the formatting options you learned about in the tutorial. You are welcome to get more creative about what you include so long as the page is easy to read and evaluate. Submit the URL to the Readme.md page (the actual page URL, not the repository URL) on Canvas.
